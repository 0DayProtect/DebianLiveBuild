### Description: Run the distributed.net client configuration utility?
#   The distributed.net client needs to be configured before it can be used.
#   While most options have reasonable defaults, you need to specify the e-mail
#   address to which you would like distributed.net to credit any work done by
#   the client. If you are installing the distributed-net package for the first
#   time, then you must configure the client, otherwise the distributed.net client
#   will refuse to start.
#   .
#   When the distributed.net client is run as a daemon (via /etc/init.d/distributed-net),
#   the output will be redirected to /var/log/distributed-net.log. You do not
#   need to set up a log file. Since the init script is controlling the
#   distributed.net client, you should not enable "quiet mode" as that breaks the
#   init script.

### Description: Use libmkl_rt.so as the default alternative to BLAS/LAPACK?
#   Intel MKL's Single Dynamic Library (SDL) is installed on your machine. This

#   become dynamically linked against it. Please verify that the licensing terms
